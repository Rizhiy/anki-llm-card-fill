- Keep changes to the minimum, only change code that is required
- Follow DRY principle, if there is an existing function/method that does something similar, try to use that instead of creating a new version.
- Write self-explainable code with clear variable and function names. Keep comments to a minimum, only add comments that to explain why you are doing something, not what you are doing.
- Be terse
- Use early-return where possible, instead of nesting logic
