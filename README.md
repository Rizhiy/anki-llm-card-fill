# Anki LLM Card Fill

## Development

Create a virtual environment with your preferred method.
e.g. for conda:

```bash
conda create -n anki-llm-card-fill python=3.9
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate anki-llm-card-fill
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ".[dev]"
```

Since Anki doesn't install dependencies automatically, we should keep them to a minimum.

Finally, link/copy the `anki_llm_card_fill` directory to relevant place on your system.
